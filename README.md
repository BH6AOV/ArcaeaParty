"发现与公布问题是为了防止有人将问题用于不法用途"

ArcaeaParty 是早期研究的结果，其目的是实现自动爬梯，通过提交虚假的成绩结果，欺骗服务器进行结算，达到目的。
众所周知，现在有越来越多的人使用软件提交虚假成绩，排行榜上甚至出现Lost为负数的情况，我觉得这样的排行榜也没有什么意义。
正如lowiro很早以前和我说过，如果我公开的话，他们会考虑关闭排行榜功能。我同意了他的想法，他也承诺做出改进。一个月后，在服务端加了一些校验。
但事实上没有什么用，我现在觉得关闭就关闭吧。
当然，我们也知道，没有任何加密手段可以完全防止作弊行为。但是鄙人觉得攻与防是一个动态的过程，因为你的游戏火爆，自然有人发起进攻，不作为自然是你的失职。
此程序代码不保证可以运行，请利用者自行分析处理，所作违法用途与作者无关。


"Making an exploit public is to prevent someone taking advantage of it"

ArcaeaParty is my early research on Arcaea's web service. This piece of code was aimed to climb event ladder automatically, by submitting fake results to fool the server.
As we know, more and more people (in China, don't know the situation in other regions) use software to submit fake results.
There are some results even has a negative 'Lost' count which is really bull shit. I think this kind of leaderboard is meaningless if lowiro doesn't make change.
Last year, when i submit this to lowiro, they want me to keep this as a secret, otherwise they may consider closing the leaderboard.
But since i am (obviously) not the only one capable of creating this secret, and the leaderboard, in my opinion, doesn't matter even they actually shut it down. 
Of cource, there is no such method that can prevent all cheating behaviours, but i think 'attack' and 'defence' should be progressive. Because your game is very hot around the world, there must be someone try to attack your system, and you should improve your defence.
This program is not guaranteed to be operational, the user should analyse it. I am not responsible for any illegal usage.
Please forgive my poor english.
